SwiftUIOrganicChem
SwiftUIOrganicChemApp is an educational iOS application built using SwiftUI. The app provides a knowledge base of organic compounds, allowing users to explore various compounds and their classifications. It includes a quiz feature to help users test and expand their knowledge of organic chemistry in an interactive way.


Features

• Knowledge Base: Users can browse a collection of organic compounds with details such as name, classification, properties, and structural images.
• Search Functionality: Search for compounds directly within the app, with data fetched from the PubChem API.
• Quiz: Engage with a multiple-choice quiz that asks users to identify the correct classification of compounds. Each quiz session consists of a set of random questions, with score tracking and feedback for correct/incorrect answers.
• Settings: Customize the app experience, including light and dark mode themes.


Technologies Used
• SwiftUI: For building the user interface and providing a smooth, interactive experience.
• PubChem API: Fetches real-time data on organic compounds, enabling dynamic content updates.
• AppStorage: Used to store user preferences for persistent settings across sessions.
• State Management: Implemented using @State, @Binding, and @Environment to ensure responsive and reactive components.
